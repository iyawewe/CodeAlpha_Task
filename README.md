# CodeAlpha_Task
This Java application is designed to input and manage student grades using a simple and intuitive interface. It allows users to enter the names and corresponding grades of multiple students and stores this data using an ArrayList. Once the data is entered, the program calculates and displays the average grade, the highest score along with the student who achieved it, and the lowest score with the respective student. The application generates a clean and organized summary report listing all student names and their grades. It can be implemented as either a console-based or GUI-based interface depending on the userâ€™s preference. The GUI version uses Java Swing to provide an interactive experience, allowing real-time input and output within a windowed application. This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming principles, data structures, and basic data analysis in Java.
